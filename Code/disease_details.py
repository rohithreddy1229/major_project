        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px; text-align: center;">Detected disease is <u>Apple Scab</u>.</h2>
        <p><strong>Apple Scab</strong> is a common and widespread fungal disease that primarily affects apple trees, though it can also infect pear trees to a lesser extent. It is prevalent in temperate regions worldwide and can lead to significant economic losses in apple orchards.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The primary symptoms of apple scab appear as olive-green to black lesions on leaves, fruit, and occasionally on young twigs. These lesions often have a velvety or scaly appearance. Infected leaves may become distorted or drop prematurely, reducing the tree's ability to photosynthesize effectively. On fruit, scab lesions can cause surface cracking and deformities, rendering them unmarketable.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Preventive Measures</h2>
        <p><strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Proper orchard management techniques, such as pruning to improve air circulation, maintaining proper tree spacing, and removing infected plant material, can help reduce the spread of apple scab.<br><br>
        <strong>Fungicide Application:</strong> Regular application of fungicides during the growing season can help prevent apple scab infection. Fungicides containing active ingredients such as mancozeb, captan, or sulfur are commonly used for control.<br><br>
        <strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Planting apple tree varieties that are resistant to apple scab can be an effective long-term strategy for managing the disease.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Causes</h2>
        <p>Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves and fruit on the ground, producing spores (ascospores) in the spring. These spores are then carried by wind or rain to infect newly emerging leaves and fruit. The disease thrives in cool, wet conditions, with optimal temperatures for infection ranging from 60Â°F to 75Â°F (15Â°C to 24Â°C), and it requires moisture on the leaf surface for spore germination and infection.</p>

        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px; text-align: center;">Detected disease is <u>Apple Black Rot</u>.</h2>
        <p><strong>Apple black rot</strong> is a serious fungal disease that primarily affects apple trees but can also infect pear and other pome fruit trees. It is prevalent in regions with warm, humid climates and can cause significant losses in fruit production and quality.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of apple black rot typically appear on fruit, although leaves and shoots can also be affected. Initially, small, brown to black lesions develop on the fruit, often near the stem or calyx end. These lesions gradually expand and become sunken, with a wrinkled or leathery appearance. As the disease progresses, the entire fruit may become mummified, shriveled, and covered with black fungal spores (conidia). On leaves and shoots, black rot can cause brown lesions and dieback.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Preventive Measures</h2>
        <p><strong>Sanitation: </strong>Remove and destroy any infected fruit, leaves, or branches to reduce the spread of the disease.<br><br>
        <strong>Pruning: </strong>Prune trees to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration, which can help reduce humidity and create less favorable conditions for fungal growth.<br><br>
        <strong>Fungicide Application: </strong>Apply fungicides preventatively during the growing season, especially during periods of warm, wet weather when the disease is most active. Fungicides containing active ingredients such as captan, thiophanate-methyl, or mancozeb are commonly used for control.<br><br>
        <strong>Fruit Bagging: </strong>Bagging fruit can provide a physical barrier against infection by preventing contact with fungal spores.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Causes</h2>
        <p>Apple black rot is caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. The fungus overwinters in infected fruit mummies, dead branches, and cankers on the tree. In spring, fungal spores (conidia) are produced on these overwintering structures and are spread by wind, rain, or insects to infect newly developing fruit and leaves. Warm, humid conditions favor disease development, with optimal temperatures for infection ranging from 75Â°F to 85Â°F (24Â°C to 29Â°C). Rain or overhead irrigation provides the moisture necessary for spore germination and infection.</p>

        <p><Strong>Apple cedar rust</Strong> primarily affects apple and crabapple trees, as well as various species of juniper and cedar trees. It is a common fungal disease in regions where these host trees are present, causing significant damage to fruit crops and ornamental trees.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of apple cedar rust typically appear on leaves, fruit, and sometimes on twigs of apple and crabapple trees. Early symptoms include small yellow-orange spots on the upper surfaces of leaves, which gradually enlarge and develop a bright orange-red color as the disease progresses. These spots may also appear on fruit, causing deformities and reducing fruit quality. On juniper and cedar trees, apple cedar rust forms galls or swellings on the branches, which release spores during wet weather conditions.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Preventive Measures</h2>
        <p><strong>Pruning: </strong>Remove and destroy any galls or infected branches on juniper and cedar trees to reduce the spread of the disease.<br><br>
        <strong>Sanitation: </strong>Remove and destroy any infected leaves, fruit, or branches from apple and crabapple trees to reduce the source of fungal spores.<br><br>
        <strong>Fungicide Application: </strong>Apply fungicides preventatively during the growing season, especially during periods of wet weather when spore production and infection are most likely to occur. Fungicides containing active ingredients such as myclobutanil or mancozeb are commonly used for control.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Causes</h2>
        <p>Apple cedar rust requires two host plants to complete its life cycle: apple or crabapple trees (genus Malus) and various species of juniper or cedar trees (genus Juniperus). The fungal pathogen overwinters as galls on juniper and cedar trees, where it produces spores (teliospores) in the spring. These spores are then carried by wind or rain to infect apple and crabapple trees, where they cause the characteristic orange-red lesions on leaves and fruit. Secondary spores (basidiospores) produced on apple and crabapple trees can then re-infect juniper and cedar trees, completing the disease cycle.</p>

        <strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Planting tomato cultivars with genetic resistance to target spot can provide effective control of the disease. Resistant varieties may exhibit fewer symptoms and require fewer fungicide applications.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Causes</h2>
        <p>Tomato target spot is caused by the fungus <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i>. The fungus can survive in infected plant debris and soil, spreading to new plants through wind-driven rain, splashing water, or mechanical means. Optimal conditions for disease development include warm temperatures ranging from 75Â°F to 85Â°F (24Â°C to 29Â°C) and high humidity. Overhead irrigation or frequent rainfall can exacerbate disease spread.</p>

        <p><strong>Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)</strong> is a viral disease that affects tomato plants, causing significant damage to crops worldwide. It belongs to the genus <i>Begomovirus</i> and is transmitted by the whitefly <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus typically include yellowing and upward curling of the leaves, along with stunted growth and reduced fruit yield. Infected plants may also exhibit leaf thickening, puckering, and vein clearing. Fruit development may be impaired, with small and distorted fruits being common.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Preventive Measures</h2>
        <p><strong>Vector Control:</strong> Managing populations of the whitefly vector, <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, is crucial for preventing the spread of TYLCV. This can be achieved through the use of insecticides targeting whiteflies and by implementing cultural control practices such as removing weed hosts.<br><br>
        <strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Planting tomato cultivars that are resistant or tolerant to TYLCV can help reduce the impact of the disease on crops. Resistant varieties can withstand virus infection better and may exhibit fewer symptoms.<br><br>
        <strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Good crop management practices, including proper sanitation, crop rotation, and removal of infected plants, can help reduce the spread of TYLCV within the tomato field.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Causes</h2>
        <p>Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus is caused by a group of viruses belonging to the genus <i>Begomovirus</i>. The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector, <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, in a persistent, circulative manner. Infected whiteflies acquire the virus from infected plants and transmit it to healthy plants during feeding. TYLCV can also spread through infected seed and plant material.</p>

        <p><strong>Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV)</strong> is a viral disease that affects tomato plants, causing significant damage to crops worldwide. It belongs to the genus <i>Tobamovirus</i> and can lead to reduced yield and fruit quality.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of Tomato Mosaic Virus typically include mosaic patterns of light and dark green on the leaves, along with leaf curling, distortion, and stunting. Infected plants may also exhibit yellowing, wilting, and necrosis of foliage. Fruit development may be impaired, with mottling, distortion, and reduced size.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 23px; ">Preventive Measures</h2>
        <p><strong>Seed Treatment:</strong> Using virus-free seed and certified disease-free transplants can help prevent the introduction of ToMV into tomato crops.<br><br>
        <strong>Vector Control:</strong> Implementing measures to control aphids, which can transmit ToMV, can help reduce the spread of the virus. Insecticides targeting aphids and cultural control practices such as removing weed hosts can be effective.<br><br>
        <strong>Cultural Practices:</strong> Good crop management practices, including proper sanitation, crop rotation, and removal of infected plants, can help reduce the spread of ToMV within the tomato field.</p>
